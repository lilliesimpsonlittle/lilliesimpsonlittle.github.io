			<article> Last Thursday, Joe White, of Enzien Audio, and I met for the first time in Finsbury park at an office called Rebel Tech. It was there that I had the blunt realisation that I was a complete beginner in the world of audio programming.
			For those that do not know, this is my first blog post of many about my time working with Enzien Audio and the work that I am going to do with them in order to get a fully functioning game level up and running using only heavy, Enzien’s own software that will convert Pure Data patches and generate them into a range of source code, like C or Java. Heavy will also allow integration of the patches into Wwise and Unity plugins, so therefore I will be using heavy to create audio for the Unity game.
			Prior to meeting up with Enzien for the first time, myself Joe and Martin had first met over a Skype call, discussing what the outcome of our time together would be and what we were to do when we first met up and when.
			On 05/11 I travelled to London to meet with Joe and head to an office by Finsbury Park called Rebel Tech to occupy some desk space together and get working on some of what we had previously planned. I had in the week leading up to our first meeting started to make and design a very basic game level in order to start getting to know Unity. It consists of four rooms with some debris around each one and an outside world which is also going to have extras around it. The meaning of the game level has not been quite decided at this point however getting a gun into the main camera was such a big achievement I feel it will become a shooting game very soon; shooting what, however, I am unsure of yet.

			In the image above, the assets I have used can be clearly seen, for example the first person character/shooter holding the gun is first noticeable along with different assets like planes for my player to stand on and the outside sky. All materials have been downloaded for free from the unity assets store.
			After looking at the games that Joe and I had each designed, we decided to take a proper look at the software Heavy and proceeded to take a downloaded patch and add it into my game.

			The above patch is a simple one of mine that was made a while ago and is a buzzing sound panned from left to right to create a machine like effect. The original patch differed slightly to this one. In order to get it to correctly work in heavy, I had to create receivers to each changeable part of the patch and therefore create sliders in order to control them once the patch had been compiled. I found I learnt a lot from Joe while doing this, not only about the heavy software but also about pure data. The next patch was taken from Andy Farnell’s ‘Designing Sound’. It was
			slightly edited in order to be compiled in heavy and then added to unity.

			At first this particular patch didn’t compile the way we thought it would. No sound came out at first even though the patch was working fine. After a while we discovered that the original name for the receiver was ‘r bang’ and due to that the compiler had discovered a bug in the patch. However as soon as the name for the receiver was changed it was up and running in unity in no time.

			Once the patch is compiled it can be made into a plug in that can be chosen in the audio mixer within unity. The problem with this is that it will constantly play and can not be added as a sound source quite yet. However it does work fantastically and can be edited with the sliders during game play and will work really well with sounds playing throughout gameplay.
			Finally, we started looking at putting in assets downloadable from the unity asset store to create a more exciting game. I then started to put in cables as can be seen below and creating sounds as triggers for when the cable is approached by the player. The plan is to eventually get the cables to snap and move around.

			It was then I had to wrap up the end of my first day at Enzien Audio in order to get back to Bristol at a reasonable hour. I learnt rather more than I thought I would about the world of games and interactive sound.
			Unfortunately we did not meet up again this week just gone due to illness however there will be a few more blog posts detailing what I have done since the first day with the help of Joe, Skype and iMessage.
